# Roadmap ðŸ¤©

Thank you for your interest in `ollama-instructor`. I've build this library to gain experience in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Python as a programming language as well. Inspired by Jason Lius [instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor) library I tried to create a library that nativly uses the Ollama client instead of the OpenAI client.

The current features of the `ollama-instructor` library are mentioned in the [README.md](/README.md) file. But as this library is still in development, there are still some features that are planned to be added. Here is a list of the features that are planned:

**Planned features**:

- [ ] Async client for chat_completion and chat_completion_with_stream
- [ ] Advanced logging

**General enhancements**:
- [ ] Add more docs and guides + structure docs
- [ ] Advanced testing

> *Note*: I'm still discovering new fields of use cases, so if you have any suggestions or ideas, please feel free to open an issue or pull request. And I would be super happy to have pull requests for example code (see [examples](/examples/)).
